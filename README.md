### 👩‍💻 Thato Mathe
Oh, hey there! I'm Thato 👩🏽‍💻

Bachelor of Science in IT final year student and web developer.
Cloud and cybersecurity enthusiast by night.
If you see me staring at the screen, I’m either coding… or questioning all my life choices while debugging.
Welcome to my portfolio!


### 🚀 About Me
I’m a dedicated, self-driven Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student with a passion for continuous learning and a strong focus on web development, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. While I’m finishing my final year, I’ve honed my skills through hands-on projects, certifications, and coding workshops with SheCodes. 
These experiences have allowed me to build meaningful web applications and explore technologies that are reshaping the future. As a web developer, I’m excited to expand into cloud and cybersecurity, where I can apply my problem-solving abilities to secure systems and optimize cloud infrastructure. 

I’m constantly learning—because tech evolves, and so do I. My journey has taught me that being a good developer is about more than just writing code; it’s about leadership, collaboration, and maintaining focus on delivering quality work. Whether I’m debugging code or building a new feature, I approach every challenge with determination and a bit of humour. I’m excited to grow, contribute, and lead in the world of technology. 🌱
