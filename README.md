🚀 About Me
Hi there! I'm Thato Mathe, a South African tech enthusiast currently in my final year of a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Richfield Graduate Institute of Technology. I’m pivoting from a rich background in hospitality into the exciting world of technology, with a specific passion for cybersecurity.

Although I’m new to IT and cybersecurity, I bring a strong foundation of technical skills and an unyielding determination to grow, learn, and make a difference. With a Google Cybersecurity Certificate under my belt, I'm building my skillset to help organizations stay secure in an ever-changing digital landscape.

I believe in using technology as a tool to solve real-world problems, a philosophy that reflects in my personal projects like the Dementia Awareness Website
When I’m not immersed in learning or coding, you can find me exploring markets, painting (still learning!), or cultivating my small garden. 🌱

💡 What I’m Working On
Portfolio Website: Showcasing my skills, projects, and certifications (Link coming soon!)
Home Lab
Skill Development: Continuously sharpening my skills in Linux, Python, SQL, and network security.

🎯 Goals
Transition into a cybersecurity career after graduation in 2025.
Build a portfolio of meaningful projects that showcase my technical abilities.
Contribute to open-source projects, particularly those focused on cybersecurity and community development.
